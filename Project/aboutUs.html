          For more than 50 years, Ogilvy has created iconic advertising for clients, and we continue to live by our founders credo of “We sell, or else”.

        <p class="small-text">
          In 1948, David Ogilvy founded the agency that would become Ogilvy. Starting with no clients and a staff of two, he built his company into one of the eight largest advertising networks in the world with more than 500 offices and 20,000 staff across 169 cities.
          Today, Ogilvy is the leader in the industry, focused on building and transforming brands. True to David’s vision, we still see ourselves as a company that does more than ads and have proven that by maintaining our humility and an almost divine discontent at our past successes, we can do more than stay relevant.
